#  LeetCode DSA Practice

This repository contains my solutions to **LeetCode problems** that I practice while learning **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
Currently, I am focusing on **C++ basics, Arrays, and Sorting** problems.  

##  Topics Covered (so far)

- ðŸŸ¢ Basics of C++ (loops, functions, input/output, etc.)  
- ðŸŸ¢ Arrays (searching, frequency, largest/smallest element, etc.)  
- ðŸŸ¢ Sorting (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort)
